# Beemo
Beemo is an application that allows you to create any project you want, and keep track of it.

You can create tasks, assign them to users, and keep track of the progress of each task. You can also create teams, and assign users to them, so you can keep track of the progress
of each team as well. All of this and more, in a simple and easy to use interface. Beemo is the perfect tool for your projects. A perfect companion for your team.

## Project Configuration

As mentioned before, VSCode is recommended for the best experience developing this project. If you are using VSCode, you can take advantage of those settings.
I implemented settings for extensions, tasks, debugger, and project settings. You can find all of them in the `.vscode` folder. I recomend you to not change those settings,
but if you want to, just make sure you know what you are doing, and you are not breaking anything.

## Project Structure

The project is structured in a way that makes it easy to navigate and understand. The project is divided in five main folders, `docs`, `prisma`, `src`, `tests` and `utils`.

### Docs

The `docs` folder contains the documentation of the project. The documentation is generated using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/). You can generate the documentation by running the `pnpm doc:generate` command, and serve it in the browser by running the `pnpm doc:serve` command.

### Prisma

The `prisma` folder contains the schema.prisma file. This file is used by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to generate the database client. You can learn more about Prisma [here](https://www.prisma.io/).

### Src

The `src` folder contains the source code of the project. This folder is divided in many subfolders, each one with a different purpose. Each subfolder is considered a module of the project and each module is separated in four subfolders, `application`, `domain`, `infrastructure` and `types`.

#### Application

The `application` folder contains the application layer of the module. This layer is responsible for the business logic of the module. This layer is divided in two subfolders, `commands` and `queries`.

#### Domain

The `domain` folder contains the domain layer of the module. This layer is responsible for the domain logic of the module. This layer is divided in two subfolders, `entities` and `value-objects`.

#### Infrastructure

The `infrastructure` folder contains the infrastructure layer of the module. This layer is responsible for the infrastructure logic of the module. This layer is divided in two subfolders, `database` and `services`.

#### Types

The `types` folder contains the types of the module. This folder is divided in two subfolders, `input-types` and `output-types`.

### Tests

The `tests` folder contains the tests of the project. The tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). You can run the tests by running the `pnpm test` command.

### Utils

The `utils` folder contains the utilities of the project.
